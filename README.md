# cacheornot
Plugin for WP Super Cache WordPress plugin to programmatically remove a page from caching if certain condition is met.

This file is a stub. You need to finish it by defining the condition to be met.

This file belongs to the plugins directory of the WP Super Cache plugin as defined in `wp-cache-config.php` by `$wp_cache_plugins_dir`

I strongly recommend to rewrite the default directory settings and set your own directory OUTSIDE wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache.
If you don't, prepare to lose this function as soon as you update the WP Super Cache plugin.
